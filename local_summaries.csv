Jed Buchwald: Isaac Newton and the Philosophy of Science | Lex Fridman Podcast #214,"Jed Buckwald is a professor of history and a philosopher of science at Caltech. Interested especially in the development of scientific concepts and the instruments used to create and explore new effects and ideas in science. This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Jed Buckwald. Does science progress via paradigm shifts and revolutions as philosopher Thomas Kuhn said, or does it progress gradually? What do you think? Well, I got into this field because I was Tom Kuhn's research assistant 50 years ago, 52 years ago. He pulled me into it out of physics instead. So I know his work pretty well. And in the years when I was at MIT running an institute, he was then in the philosophy department, used to come over all the time to the talks we held and so on. So what would I say about that? He, of course, developed his ideas a lot over the years. The thing that he's famous for, the str"

His research interests center around the capabilities and limits of quantum computers and computational complexity theory more generally. He is an excellent writer and one of my favorite communicators of computer science in the world. We only had about an hour and a half for this conversation, so I decided to focus on quantum computing, but I can see us talking again on this podcast at some point about computational complexity theory and all the complexity classes that Scott catalogs in his amazing Complexity Zoo Wiki. My goal with these conversations is to try to be in the background without ego and do three things. One, let the guests shine and try to discover together the most beautiful insights in their work and in their mind. Two, try to play devil's advocate, just enough."
Albert Bourla: Pfizer CEO | Lex Fridman Podcast #249,"Albert Burla, CEO of Pfizer, talks about truth, human nature, and the burden of being human, of being free. The timestamps as always are below. If you'd like to skip ahead to our conversation, the timestamps as always are below. But if not, please allow me to say a few words about truth and human nature. Specifically, about two groups of people throughout history that seek to lay claim to the truth. The first group will tell you that only they possess the truth, and that the government will save you, the company will save you, the science, the authorities, the experts, the institutions will save you. The second group, too, will tell you that only they possess the truth, and that the government will hurt you, the company will hurt you, the science, the authorities, the experts, the institutions will hurt you. Both groups have the benevolent and the malevolent, their heroes and their charlatans. And I think the hard truth is that no one in this world can tell you with absolute certainty which is which. You have to use your mind. This is the burden of being human, of being free."
Yeonmi Park: North Korea | Lex Fridman Podcast #196,"From 1994 to 1998, North Korea went through a famine, mass starvation, caused primarily by King Jong-il, who at the time was the new leader of North Korea after his father's death in 1994. Somewhere between 600,000 and 3 million people died due to starvation. From all the stories of famine in history, including my own family history, I've come to understand that hunger tortures the human mind in a way that can break everything we stand for. In North Korea, during the 90s famine, many were driven to cannibalism. Imagine more than 10 million people suffering starvation for months and years, always on the brink of death."

Her books include Machines Who Think in 1979, The Fifth Generation in 1983 with Ed Fagenbaum, who's considered to be the father of expert systems, The Edge of Chaos that features women, and many more books. I came across her work in an unusual way by stumbling in a quote from Machines Who Think that is something like, artificial intelligence began with the ancient wish to forge the gods. That was a beautiful way to draw a connecting line between our societal relationship with AI from the grounded day-to-day science, math, and engineering to popular stories and science fiction and myths of automatons that go back for centuries. Through her literary work, she has spent a lot of time with the seminal figures of artificial intelligence, including the founding fathers of AI from the 1956 Dartmouth summer workshop where the field was launched."

The most defining characteristic of his approach to science and biology is that of a first principles thinker and engineer focused not just on defining the problem, but finding the solution. In that spirit, we talk about cheap rapid at home testing, which is a solution to COVID-19 that to me has become one of the most obvious, powerful and doable solutions that frankly should have been done months ago and still should be done now. As we talk about its accuracy, it's high for detecting actual contagiousness and hundreds of millions can be manufactured quickly and relatively cheaply. In general, I love engineering solutions like these even if government bureaucracies often don't. It respects science and data, it respects our freedom, it respects our intelligence, it respects our intelligence and basic common sense.

As a side note, let me say a word about asymptotic freedom. Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of an atom, strong interaction is responsible for the strong nuclear force that binds them, but strong interaction also holds together the quarks that make up the protons and neutrons. Frank Wilczek, David Gross, and David Pulitzer came up with a theory postulating that when quarks come really close to one another, the attraction abates and they behave like free particles. This is called asymptotic freedom. This happens at very, very high energies, which is also where all the fun is."

Imagine if you can live 100,000 years, even under controlled conditions, like in a spaceship, say, then suddenly a trip to Alpha Centauri that is 4.37 light years away takes a single human lifespan. And on the psychological, maybe even philosophical level, as the horizons of death d"

Jimmy Pedro: Judo and the Forging of Champions | Lex Fridman Podcast #236,"The most beautiful throw in judo to me is Uchi Mata. It's the one that seems to have the most amplitude. Person goes the highest. You see a leg swing through the middle, the person doing the throw, there's a leg swinging through the middle, the other person definitely goes, you know, head over heels, flat on their back. It's probably the most dynamic, pretty judo throw there is."
Richard Wolff: Marxism and Communism | Lex Fridman Podcast #295,"This podcast is a conversation with Richard Wolff, one of the top Marxist economists and philosophers in the world. This is a heavy topic in general and for me personally given my family history in the Soviet Union, in Russia, and in Ukraine. Today the words Marxism, Socialism, and Communism are used to attack and to divide much more than to understand and to learn. With this podcast I seek the latter. I believe we need to study the ideas of Karl Marx as well as their various implementations throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries. And in general we need to b"

Nick Bostrom: Simulation and Superintelligence | Lex Fridman Podcast #83,"A conversation with Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at University of Oxford and the director of the Future of Humanity Institute. He has worked on fascinating and important ideas in existential risk, simulation hypothesis, human enhancement ethics, and the risks of superintelligent AI systems, including in his book, Superintelligence. I can see talking to Nick multiple times in this podcast, many hours each time, because he has done some incredible work in artificial intelligence, in technology space, science, and really philosophy in general. But we have to start somewhere. This conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic that both Nick and I, I'm sure, will have a lot to say about next time we speak. And perhaps that is for the best, because the deepest lessons can be learned only in retrospect when the storm has passed."

Life should be lived fully.

Life should be lived fully. A conversation with Matt Walker, sleep scientist, professor of neuroscience and psychology at Berkeley, author of Why We Sleep, and the host of a new podcast called The Matt Walker Podcast. It's 10 minute episodes a couple of times a month, covering sleep and other health and science topics. I love it and recommend it highly. It's up there with the greats, like the Huberman Lab podcast with Andrew Huberman, and I think David Sinclair is putting out an audio series soon too. I can't wait to listen to it.
